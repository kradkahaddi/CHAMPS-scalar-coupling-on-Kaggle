# CHAMPS-scalar-coupling-on-Kaggle
A contest about measuring molecular measurements. My hope was to reduce the problem to a geometric problem and then use distance measures and weighted measures to arrive at a result.

Also note that I chose to ignore the update in rules to allow the use of the extended dataset. The hosts of the competition were unhappy about the development and I wanted to respect their original intentions. I wanted to see how the challenge would be originally and what I could achieve with the original dataset.
